JavaScript Engine

JavaScript Engine allows us to communicate our JS to a computer. A computer only understands 1s and 0s but because
of the engine the computer can understand what I want to make it do. There are tons of these ECMAScript engines!
The V8 JS engine is written in C++. JS used to be slow until around 2008 when Google created the V8 engine so Chrome
can run JS faster in the browser for Google Maps.

Inside the Engine 

V8 is the most common and popular engine used by Chrome and NodeJS. We give the engine our JS file, then it is parsed and formed
into a tree like structure called AST (abstract syntax tree). Go to astexplorer.net to see how it works! It would be total chaos if
everyone created their own engines. ECMAScript is the governing body and tells engine creators how JS should work. Companies battle
to have the fastest engine to create the fastest browser so they can retain the most users and sell ads!

Interpreter and Compiler

In programming there are generally two ways to make our computer understand what we want it to do.
An Interpreter translates line by line on the fly. A Compiler unlike an interpreter does not work on the fly.
It passes over all the code as opposed to line by line and converts it to a new language for the computer to understand.
Usually it's converted into machine code a lower level language.
